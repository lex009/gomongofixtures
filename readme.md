GOMONGOFIXTURE
==============

It is a simple library to load MongoDB data from files generated by `mongoexport` utility into your database
for testing reasons or whatever reason you'd like.

Warnings
--------

It uses [official MongoDB driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) as well as [tools](github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools-common) used by MongoDB cli utilities,
that use [unmaintined driver](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo).
